trafacct toolset documentation

INTRODUCTION
There are many offline log analyzers out there. Most of those, however are to be used with only one corresponding traffic control  system - some parse squid logs, others process tcpdump output. This specialization is easy to understand - a great amount of work is requried to consistently monitor all possible format variation and changes of a wide set of services.

Trafacct was developed to provide a common interface for any network service that manages input and output traffic. This allows user to monitor and classify all traffic passing through a host. Overall traffic statistics might help to collect statistics of different kinds, monitor bandwidth usage, implement an elaborate billing system or detect a viral network activity.

INSTALLATION
On this early stage there are no installation packages or scripts for trafacct. The installation procedure follows:
* ensure scala (of version >= 2.7) is installed
* install JArgs http://jargs.sourceforge.net/ (this dependency will hopefully be eliminated in the future)
* dowload an archive with trafacct sources from https://github.com/basilevs/trafacct
* unpack
* compile with scalac *.scala in decompressed trafacct directory

An alternative way is to clone git repository to obtain updates easily:
git clone git://github.com/basilevs/trafacct.git trafacct #clones repository to a new folder trafacct
cd trafacct && git pull #updates repository

CONFIGURATION
Trafacct toolset reads its configuration from following locations:
* command line -c key (accepts a path to an xml file)
* ~/.trafacct/config.xml (not with -c key)
* config.xml (from current working directory, not with -c key)
* other command line switches

Each location extends previously read configuration. All configuration lists are appended with new content, configuration values are overwritten. The only exception is <select> section of configuration files - it is dropped if the new configuration unit has a nonempty one.

XML CONFIGURATION
Example of configuration XML file can be found in doc/config.xml
Trafacct configuration file has the following structure
<configuration>
  <limit>NUMBER</limit>
  <categories>
	NAMED_CATEGORIES
  </categories>
  <activeCategories>
	CATEGORIES
  </activeCategories>
  <skip>
	CATEGORIES
  </skip>
  <select>
	CATEGORIES
  </select>
  <sources>
	SOURCES
  </sources>
</configuration>

<limit>NUMBER</limit> - a limit for a number of statistic lines that are printed to output by tools

<skip> section enumerates hosts traffic to or from which is to be dropped out of statistics

<select> section enumerates hosts whose inbound and outbound should be processed by trafacct. If this section is empty all traffic is processed and display in statistics (except skipped, see <skip>)

<inactiveCategories> prevents categorization of hosts matching the section's content with By*Category tools. Every matching host will heave its own statistics line in tool report.


CATEGORIES - is a list of elements of following types:
<Host name="domain_name" ip="numerical_ip"> - 	represents  a single host, name or ip properties might be ommitted
<SubNet ip="" maskLength=number> - selfexplanatory
<Category name=""> - named category

NAMED_CATEGORIES - a list of category definitions:
<Category name="name_of_category_being_defined">
	CATEGORIES
</Category>
Category collections assigned a name (replace name_of_category_being_defined with any suitable string)this way may be used in <select>, <skip> and <activeCategories> sections and also in other category definitions below (order is important here).

<sources> - a main section of configuration file. Contains a description of data sources to analyze. The following elements are supported: <NetAcctDir dir="/var/log/net-acct"/> a path to logs of net-acct daemon http://exorsus.net/projects/net-acct/ (now unavialable)
<SquidDir dir="/var/log/net-acct"/> a path to squid logs now only the default squid log format is supported: %ts.%03tu %6tr %>a %Ss/%03>Hs %<st %rm %ru %un %Sh/%<A %mt

Any number of sources might be present. Beware, that sources listed more than once will be processed the same number of times making the corresponding effect in statistic output. If no sources if given by configuration files, a simple detection mehanism is used to initialize this list. Use DumpConfig tool to see results.

If you are processing a proxy logs be sure to <skip> traffic to the proxy host itself as it would be accounted twice if you are using gateway traffic logger.

As single developer can't provide every network activity log parser needed, users are encouraged to implement their own parsers to adapt toolset to their needs. API documentation for that is coming soon.

COMMAND LINE
A toolset has a number of builtin statistic analyzing tools:

* DumpConfig
Dump XML configuration on standart output. All command switches effects are included. Helpful for generation of new configuration files.
* Full
For each uniq triplet of source, destination, protocol prints amount of traffic transferred.
* ByCategory
Like Full, but source and destination are replaced by host categories. Use it to reduce amount of output for traffic in you heavy loaded local subnet.
* BySourceCategory
ByCategory with destination distinction ommited
* ByDestinationCategory
ByCategory with source distinction ommited

Each of them can be run with the following command line:

CLASSPATH=path_to_your_trafacct_folder scala trafacct.name_of_tool <options>

You may define required CLASSPATH enviroment variable in a user profile of your OS. If this is the case command reduces to:

scala trafacct.name_of_tool <options>

COMMAND LINE KEYS
To futher tune behaviour of trafacct without making changes to configuration files there are commnd line options. They should be appended to command line after tool name (see previous section).

-c filename, --config filename - parses XML file with configuration. Is processed before any other command line options. May appear multiple times - each file mentioned will be parsed.

-s START_DATE, --start START_DATE
-e END_DATE, --end END_DATE
Determines an interval of time to get statistics for. All log entries with timestamps older than START_DATE or newer than END_DATE will be dropped.
Dates should be in the format : YYYY-MM-DD.

-d DATE, --date DATE
Equivalent to -s DATE -e DATE.

-a, --human-readable - enables reverse DNS resolution and human readable numbers in output

-h CATEGORY - selects a host category to be processed. All trafic that don't go to or from the host from to the category given will be dropped. May appear multilpe times - traffic from all categories will be accounted. A presence of this option makes toolset forget about categories selected by configuration files.
CATEGORY might be in one the following formats:
ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd/dd - a subnet
ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd - a single host
NAME_LITERAL - a name of named category

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
A number of optional unnamed arguments are supported. All of them are controlling time intervals at the moment (see <start>,<end> description at XML CONFIGURATION).

Each argument denotes a different time interval for data to be processde from:
today - processes data registered since today's midnight
yesterday - from yesterday's midnight to today's midnight
week - since week ago
month - since month ago
